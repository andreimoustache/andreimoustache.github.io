_Alternate title: planning for GCP Pub/Sub, something something capacity/resources?_


Cloud is everywhere / cloud-everything / HMMM, so
cloud providers make it easy to hit the ground running with most of their products.
This is amazing for innovation, as you can get a proof-of-concept up and running faster than you can say _‘yadda-yadda-next-next-next-deploy-woo-rocket-emoji’_.
Something something price, computing is cheap and everything, but nobody wants to be wasteful, especially with money, so estimating cost is something that I include in my solution proposals; this is great for the business, as they can budget things more accurately, but also great for me, because I can compare WHAT e.g. serverless VS always-on VM.
