_This blog's starting point, the `git init`, the CTRL+N, the right-click > create new. Also, maybe a few words about me._

## About this
_Is `this` the real lie, or is `this` just fantasy?_

If I'm mumbling and frowning at the screen, I'm "ranting", but if I do it on a blog, I'm "giving back", so here we are!

Jokes aside, had to start somewhere, and this is it. This is my `print "Hello, world!"`; actually, my `hugo new site`,
because we gone full circle and we servin' static files up in here. With [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

_¤ Interlude ¤_

Static site generators have been around for a while now, and seem to only get more and more popular. 
Of course, before that, there was the good ol' bunch of straight-up `HTML` & `CSS`, _hand-crafted_ in `Dreamweaver`.
I'm only going as far back as I can remember ;) This is how I made my first beer money – some nights those were!

Then came `PHP` and the like, and all sorts of computation-intensive software that added some gain, but removed the
overall simplicity. Computation might be convenient to get hold of, but in some cases it might not be worth it or just
wasteful...

And it makes sense, especially for a blog. No need for computation, no need for fancy server-side logic, because it's
only text that people read. Hopefully.

**So, think of the children and use less CPU!** :sunny:

_Whew, that was a mouthful!_

_¤ Now back to this ¤_

I love supporting the local communities, but I've mostly only been an _attendant_.
Recently I've started giving technical presentations here and there, and it's been great! I prefer skinny slides, but
in order to get them, I always end up writing a bulkier version in a separate document. Those are by no means mature
enough to count as _articles_, but I figured I might as well bake them until they're worthy, and post them here.

## About me

_Mi mi mi mi miiii :musical_note:_

My name is Andrei Mustață; last name is literally _moustache_, so I can say I have been _#blessed:sparkles:_ with a name
that I can uhm... translate into English, sparing people of a few seconds of awkwardness when trying to pronounce the
original.

I am a software engineer, currently interested in automating processes, _pipelines_, infrastructure, and other suchlike.
While most of my experience is in development (actually writing code), I've always gotten my feet wet with everything
involved in the process of making software, and in all its stages. I also prefer to have a higher-level view of systems
and more importantly, the value parts bring; **never liked being bound to just one** of the many hats that are worn in
software.

And there you have it, that's our time-slot for today! Thanks for tuning in, hope to see you again, take care, buh-bye
now!

_FIN_
